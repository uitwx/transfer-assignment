# How to use `git` 

1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add` 
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit` (Do not forget the commit message)
4. See your history with `git log` 
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout` or  `git switch` 
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b <branch name>` or `git branch <branch name>`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
